## 🦋 About This Eccentric Analyst

I'm a workforce analyst who decided that spreadsheets and dashboards, while amazing, aren't quite enough to contain my ambitions! Currently on an exciting journey from data analysis to cloud development, because why not combine the best of both worlds?

**My Vibe:** Professional expertise meets creative chaos. I believe the most innovative solutions come from thinking outside conventional boundaries while maintaining analytical rigor.

**The Journey:** Workforce Analytics → Cloud Development → Building systems that actually make people's work lives better (with style!)
